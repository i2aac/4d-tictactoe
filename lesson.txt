To begin, let us first understand a 1-D game of tic-tac-toe.
/
A 1-D game of tic-tac-toe comprises of only one row. Within this one row, a straight line can be constructed by taking up an entire row. Given that only one row exists, this makes the game impossible to win in practice.

O|X|X <--- The singular 1-D row.
/
This is very boring, so let us move on to 2-D. Now, both rows and columns can be filled to form a straight line. In addition, diagonal lines may now also form a straight line.

O| |X
-----
 |O|X
-----
O| |X
/
Although this board and its properties are trivially obvious to 3-D beings, they would not be to any 1-D observers. To get a sense for how to understand higher dimensions, we must first understand how a tic-tac-toe board goes from 1-D to 2-D.
/
A 2-D board of tic-tac-toe is really just multiple 1-D boards stitched together.

#1 O| |X
   -----
#2  |O|X
   -----
#3 O| |X
/
If we analyze the 2-D board with this in mind, it becomes clear that every winning pattern in 2-D can be defined with its 1-D components. To start, let us define the two kinds of straight lines that can win a game of tic-tac-toe:
/
I. Orthogonal lines.
In 2-D, these are lines that run along just a single row, or column. In higher level dimensions, these can be expressed as lines whose length can be expressed as the integer value n, where n is the side length of the board grid.

 | |X
-----
 | |X
-----
 | |X
/
II. Pythagorean lines
In 2-D, these are diagonal lines that run along multiple rows and columns. In higher level dimensions, these can be expressed as lines whose length is that of the highest dimensional diagonal of the board grid, expressed as the square root of the sum of the squares of each side length of the grid.

O| |
-----
 |O|
-----
 | |O
/
Pythagorean lines should not be thought of as encompassing all diagonal lines, as this is only the case in 2-D. Higher dimensional games of tic-tac-toe contain diagonal lines whose plane is orthogonal to other cross-sectional boards.
/
Now, let us express each winning case of 2-D tic-tac-toe using its 1-D components. The first and simplest case is that in which one of the 1-D boards entirely contains an orthogonal line.

#1  | |
   -----
#2 X|X|X
   -----
#3  | |

This sets the first rule that may be used to understand higher dimensional tic-tac-toe:
/
1. If a winning pattern works in a given dimension, n, it will also work in all dimensions higher than n. (e.g, any winning pattern that works in 2-D will work in 3-D, 4-D, 5-D, etc...)
/
The next case is that in which an orthogonal line runs across a column.

#1  | |O
   -----
#2  | |O
   -----
#3  | |O

This sets the second rule that may be used to understand higher dimensional tic-tac-toe:
/
2. All orthogonal straight lines not confined to a single component planes may be expressed as a marking (an X or an O) being placed at every equivalent space just one dimension higher than its component planes.
/
For example, if we were to overlay each of the three 1-D boards in the previous figure over each other, the O's would all end up in the same place, that being the right-most space.

The final case is Pythagorean lines.
/
#1 X| |
   -----
#2  |X|
   -----
#3  | |X

This case is the most complex, but it can be simplified to the third and final rule that may be used to understand higher dimensional tic-tac-toe:
/
3. All Pythagorean lines may be expressed as an orthogonal or Pythagorean line just one dimension lower, whose markings (X's or O's) are sequentially spread across adjacent planes.
/
For example, if we were to again overlay each of the 1-D boards over each other, the X's from the previous figure would form an orthogonal line.
/
Now that it is understood how games of tic-tac-toe scale from 1-D to 2-D, it shall be demonstrated how a 3-D board may be projected onto a 2-D space.
/
Much like how a 2-D board may be defined as composed of multiple 1-D boards, a 3-D board may be defined as composed of multiple 2-D boards.

#1      #2      #3
X| |    O| |X   O| |X
-----   -----   -----
O|X|     |X|     | |O
-----   -----   -----
O| |    O| |X   O|X|
/
For three dimensional beings, it is trivial to visualize these 2-D cross-sections as layers placed together to form a 3-D grid.

All three previously explored winning cases can be expressed using their respective rules that were deduced from the respective winning case. Briefly, they are demonstrated here:
/
1. If a winning pattern works in a given dimension, n, it will also work in all dimensions higher than n. (e.g, any winning pattern that works in 2-D will work in 3-D, 4-D, 5-D, etc...)

#1      #2      #3
 | |    X| |     | |
-----   -----   -----
 | |     |X|     | |
-----   -----   -----
 | |     | |X    | |
/
Notice that grid #2 displays a winning pattern that would also work in 2-D, if you were to consider only grid #2.
/
2. All orthogonal straight lines not confined to a single component planes may be expressed as a marking (an X or an O) being placed at every equivalent space just one dimension higher than its component planes.

#1      #2      #3
 |O|     |O|     |O|
-----   -----   -----
 | |     | |     | |
-----   -----   -----
 | |     | |     | |
/
Notice that what would be an orthogonal line in 3-D, appears as a marker being placed at the same location in every component planes, when the board is split into , when the board is split into its component planes.
/
3. AAll Pythagorean lines may be expressed as an orthogonal or Pythagorean line just one dimension lower, whose markings (X's or O's) are sequentially spread across adjacent planes.

#1      #2      #3
X| |     | |     | |
-----   -----   -----
 | |     |X|     | |
-----   -----   -----
 | |     | |     | |X
/
As well as:

 #1      #2      #3
 | |     | |    O| |
-----   -----   -----
 | |    O| |     | |
-----   -----   -----
O| |     | |     | |
/
Notice that what would appear to be Pythagorean lines in 3-D, appear as orthogonal when each board has its respective grids overlayed.
/
With the third dimension now understood, it is time to express the fourth dimension. Three dimensional beings often struggle to get a sense for it, so it is best to start with an easy-to-follow pattern. Every dimension, n, is comprised of n - 1 dimensional cross sections. For example, 3-D shapes can be split into 2-D cross sections that make up 2-D shapes, and 2-D shapes can be split into 1-D cross sections that make up 1-D lines.
/
Logically, therefore, a 4-D shape would be comprised of 3-D cross sections. Specifically for tic-tac-toe, a 4-D board can be expressed by its component boards, each being in 3-D. The following visualization will represent one 3-D cross-section with each row.
/
    |X|     | |     | |
   -----   -----   -----
#1 O| |     | |     |X|
   -----   -----   -----
    | |     |O|X    |O|

    | |     |X|     | |
   -----   -----   -----
#2 X| |    O| |     |O|
   -----   -----   -----
    | |    O| |     |X|

    | |     | |    O| |
   -----   -----   -----
#3  |X|    O|X|     | |
   -----   -----   -----
   X| |     | |     | |
/
Once again, all three previously explored winning cases can be expressed using their respective rules that were deduced from the respective winning case. Briefly, they are demonstrated here:
/
1. If a winning pattern works in a given dimension, n, it will also work in all dimensions higher than n. (e.g, any winning pattern that works in 2-D will work in 3-D, 4-D, 5-D, etc...)

   X| |     | |     | |
   -----   -----   -----
#1  | |     |X|     | |
   -----   -----   -----
    | |     | |     | |X

    | |     | |     | |
   -----   -----   -----
#2  | |     | |     | |
   -----   -----   -----
    | |     | |     | |

    | |     | |     | |
   -----   -----   -----
#3  | |     | |     | |
   -----   -----   -----
    | |     | |     | |
/
Notice that the demonstrated winning pattern would also win a 3-D game that considers only the first 3-D cross-section.
/
2. All orthogonal straight lines not confined to a single component planes may be expressed as a marking (an X or an O) being placed at every equivalent space just one dimension higher than its component planes.

    | |     | |     | |
   -----   -----   -----
#1  | |     | |     | |
   -----   -----   -----
    | |     |O|     | |

    | |     | |     | |
   -----   -----   -----
#2  | |     | |     | |
   -----   -----   -----
    | |     |O|     | |

    | |     | |     | |
   -----   -----   -----
#3  | |     | |     | |
   -----   -----   -----
    | |     |O|     | |
/
Notice that the demonstrated orthogonal line is in the exact same place in every 3-D cross-section.
/
3. All Pythagorean lines may be expressed as an orthogonal or Pythagorean line just one dimension lower, whose markings (X's or O's) are sequentially spread across adjacent planes.
 
   X| |     | |     | |
   -----   -----   -----
#1  | |     | |     | |
   -----   -----   -----
    | |     | |     | |

    | |     | |     | |
   -----   -----   -----
#2  | |     |X|     | |
   -----   -----   -----
    | |     | |     | |

    | |     | |     | |
   -----   -----   -----
#3  | |     | |     | |
   -----   -----   -----
    | |     | |     | |X
/
Notice that if you overlay each 3-D cross-section, the line appears to be a Pythagorean line in the resulting 3-D grid.
/
Upon breaking down 4-D tic-tac-toe into its lower dimensional components, it becomes more understandable to beings lacking a higher dimensional perspective.
