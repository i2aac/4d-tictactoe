# 4d-tictactoe
This iteration of 4-D tic-tac-toe simply upscales a 2-D tic-tac-toe board to 4-D. A board of size 3 looks as such:
```
 |X|     | |     | |
-----   -----   -----
O| |     | |     |X|
-----   -----   -----
 | |     |O|X    |O|

 | |     |X|     | |
-----   -----   -----
X| |    O| |     |O|
-----   -----   -----
 | |    O| |     |X|
 
 | |     | |    O| |
-----   -----   -----
 |X|    O|X|     | |
-----   -----   -----
X| |     | |     | |
```
You may compile the code rather simply.
```
gcc main.cpp
```
